# Price-Tracker
This price tracker is made to monitor prices of products on online market place. User can set the target price of the product and as soon as the product hits the target of goes below it due to some discout on the market place the user receives a email.

This might not work with every ecommerce website since some of them do not allow to scrap their data, so we recieve no price information.
